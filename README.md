# Forschungsprojekt


## Project feature:

- Project displays map, and loads graph file onto it
- computes Dijkstra by providing alphas and stard id and end id
- computes A* Standard and ALT
- path still can be computed without providing node ids by clicking on map

## How to run Project:  
  Backend without Frontend only:
  - Install only the folder "Backend Dij"
  - import Project
  - Run project through preferable java compiler ( Eclipse, Visual Studio Code...)
  - Provide directory for graph file in terminal
  - Provide cost coefficient

How to start **Frontend**:
  - cd angularclient
  - npm start

How to start **Backend**:
- cd spring_backend
- compile the class **SpringBackendApplication.java**

Requirements for project:
- Maven installed for springboot
- [Angular set up](https://angular.io/guide/setup-local)
